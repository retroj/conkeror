conkeror (1.0~~pre+git120102-1) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Axel Beckert ]
  * Upstream version bump
  * Upstream changed minimum xulrunner requirement to 1.9.1: Update
    debian/control and debian/conkeror.bin accordingly.
  * Reorder xulrunner alternative dependencies so the current xulrunner
    from unstable (9.0) is chosen by default.
  * Make package usable on Ubuntu again despite their xulrunner removal.
    - debian/control: Add alternative dependencies on firefox instead of
      xulrunner
    - debian/conkeror.bin: If no xulrunner is found, look for firefox
      instead
    - debian/control: Update long description to mention Firefox, too.
  * Add alternative dependencies on xulrunner-11.0, -10.0, and -9.0.
  * Support xulrunner 11.0 in debian/conkeror.bin

  [ Luca Capello ]
  * Support xulrunner 10.0 and 9.0 in debian/conkeror.bin, drop support
    for unversioned xulrunner binaries. (Closes: #649199)

 -- Axel Beckert <abe@debian.org>  Mon, 02 Jan 2012 20:12:01 +0100

conkeror (0.9.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream milestone
  * Add support for xulrunner-7.0 and xulrunner-8.0
  * Reorder xulrunner dependencies in debian/control:
    + xulrunner-6.0 is the first dependency as that's the highest version
      currently in Debian unstable.
    + All other versions are sorted descending by their version, the
      non-versioned xulrunner being the last one.

 -- Axel Beckert <abe@debian.org>  Sun, 04 Sep 2011 22:32:03 +0200

conkeror (0.9.3+git110719-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream snapshot
    - Fullscreen toggling support, use F11 or M-S-Return
  * Make reportbug helper script to work with any installed xulrunner
    package. Thanks to Luca Capello!
  * Change versioned dependency on "xulrunner" to a non-versioned
    dependency, because xulrunner 1.8 is really history (last seen in
    Etch) and it should work with a potential virtual "xulrunner"
    package. (See #567169)
  * debian/control: Prefer xulrunner-5.0 over xulrunner-1.9.1 as 5.0 is
    now in unstable and 1.9.1 will probably vanish soon.
  * Add alternative dependency on xulrunner-6.0 which was missing in the
    last upload.

conkeror (0.9.3+git110307-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/conkeror.bin: Change search order for searching xulrunner
    binaries from the confusing current state of "squeeze/sid, (former)
    experimental, lenny, experimental, generic/sarge" to descending
    "highest, most specific versions first; lowest, generic versions
    last", so it should take the newest xulrunner version which is
    installed.

    make the patch much more robust against changes in upstream's default
    modules list. Thanks to John J. Foerch for the suggestion.

  * New upstream snapshot
  * Make package working on Ubuntu again by reverting debian/conkeror.bin
    to not using xulrunner-stub symbolic links anymore since Ubuntu doesn't

  * Added alternative dependency on xulrunner-1.9.1
  * Moved from directly calling "xulrunner application.ini" to calling a
    symlinked xulrunner-stub (symlinking xulrunner-stub only works with

    decide which version of xulrunner is actually used.
  * Refreshed debian/patches/sensible-editor.diff after upstream
    whitespace changes.
  * Changed debian/rules to not use the old $CONKEROR_VERSION$ macro

    compatibility to 7.

    '$CONKEROR_VERSION$'.
  * Remove suggestion of zile since conkeror currently can't handle
    text-mode only editors. Suggest the virtual package emacsen instead.
  * Depends now on "xulrunner (>= 1.9~) | xulrunner-1.9" instead of solely
    "xulrunner-1.9".

    are no upstream releases to watch (yet).
